- ✅ **User images and carousels are preserved**
- ✅ **R2 Analytics data is backed up**
- ✅ **Personal events and user settings are maintained**

### **What Gets Backed Up**
1. **Admin Users** - Your admin account with all permissions and settings

## 🚀 How to Use the System

### **Before Making Database Changes (Recommended Workflow)**

```bash
# Create a comprehensive backup with your admin account
npx tsx scripts/dev-workflow-backup.ts backup lucid8080@gmail.com
```

This will:
- Create a full backup of all critical data
- Specifically preserve your admin account
- Store everything in the `backups/` directory

### **After Database Wipes (Restore Everything)**

```bash
# Restore all data including your admin account
npx tsx scripts/dev-workflow-backup.ts restore lucid8080@gmail.com
```

### **Quick Admin Restore (If Only Admin Access is Lost)**

```bash
# Just restore admin access quickly
npx tsx scripts/dev-workflow-backup.ts admin-restore lucid8080@gmail.com
```

### **Check What Backups Are Available**

```bash
# See all available backups
npx tsx scripts/dev-workflow-backup.ts status
```

### **Test Restoration Without Making Changes**

```bash
# Safe testing mode
npx tsx scripts/dev-workflow-backup.ts restore --dry-run
```

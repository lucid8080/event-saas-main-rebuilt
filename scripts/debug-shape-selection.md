# Debug: Shape Selection Not Working

## Issue
User reports that "choose shapes are not working"

## Analysis
The shape selection code looks correct:

### 1. **Shape Data Structure** ✅
- `shapes` array is properly defined with 8 different aspect ratios
- Each shape has `id`, `aspect`, `width`, `height`, `name`, `description`

### 2. **State Management** ✅  
- `selectedShape` state is properly initialized as `null`
- `setSelectedShape` is called correctly in click handler

### 3. **Click Handler** ✅
```tsx
onClick={() => {
  setSelectedShape(shape);
  setCurrentStep(4);
}}
```

### 4. **Visual Feedback** ✅
- Selected shape gets purple border and background
- Conditional styling based on `selectedShape?.id === shape.id`

### 5. **Auto-Expand Logic** ✅
- When style selected: `setIsShapeSectionCollapsed(false)`
- When event details valid: `setIsShapeSectionCollapsed(false)`

## Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Section Not Expanded
- Shapes section starts collapsed (`isShapeSectionCollapsed: true`)
- User needs to click "3. Choose Shape" header to expand
- OR complete step 2 to auto-expand

### Issue 2: Step Progression
- User might not have completed steps 1 & 2 properly
- Shapes might be visible but clicking doesn't work due to validation

### Issue 3: JavaScript Errors
- Runtime errors preventing click handlers
- Check browser console for errors

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check if shapes section is expanded**
   - Look for the grid of shape options
   - If not visible, click "3. Choose Shape" header

2. **Verify step completion**
   - Step 1: Event type selected ✅
   - Step 2: Style selected OR event details filled ✅

3. **Check browser console**
   - Any JavaScript errors?
   - React state updates working?

4. **Test click responsiveness**
   - Are the shape buttons clickable?
   - Do they show hover effects?

## Most Likely Solution
The shapes section is collapsed and user needs to either:
- Click the "3. Choose Shape" header to expand manually
- OR complete step 2 properly to auto-expand

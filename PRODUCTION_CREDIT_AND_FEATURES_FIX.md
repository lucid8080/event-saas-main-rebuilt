- ANIMATIONS: UI animations (LOW IMPACT)
- PERFORMANCE_MONITORING: Dev tools (LOW IMPACT)
```

## üîß **Immediate Fix Actions**

### **Step 1: Re-enable Critical Features**

#### **1.1 Set Production Environment Variables**
Add these environment variables to your production environment (Render/Vercel/etc.):

```env
# Critical Features - RE-ENABLE IMMEDIATELY
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CLOUD_SERVICES=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CHARTS=true

# Enhanced Features - RE-ENABLE AFTER CRITICAL
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_IMAGE_PROCESSING=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANIMATIONS=true

# Development Features - OPTIONAL
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PERF_MONITORING=false
```

#### **1.2 Verify R2 Environment Variables**
Ensure these R2 variables are set in production:
```env
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-r2-access-key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-r2-secret-key
R2_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
R2_ENDPOINT=https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

### **Step 2: Fix Credit Application Issue**

#### **2.1 Check Production Database**
Run this script on your production server to verify user roles:

```bash
# On production server
npx tsx scripts/diagnose-credit-application.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Found 1 admin users:
   - lucid8080@gmail.com (HERO)
```

**If No Admin Users Found:**
```bash
# Create admin user
npx tsx scripts/create-admin-user.ts
```

#### **2.2 Test Production API Endpoints**
Test the credit management API directly:

```bash
# Test API endpoint (replace with your production URL)
curl -X PATCH https://your-production-url.com/api/admin/users/USER_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"credits": 100}'
```

#### **2.3 Verify Authentication**
Check if the admin user can log into production:
1. Go to your production site
2. Log in with `lucid8080@gmail.com`
3. Navigate to `/admin`
4. Check if user management is accessible

### **Step 3: Monitor and Test**

#### **3.1 Test Re-enabled Features**
After setting environment variables:

1. **Test Cloud Services**:
   - Go to image generation
   - Verify images are saved to R2
   - Check gallery loads correctly

2. **Test Charts**:
   - Go to admin dashboard
   - Verify charts and analytics load
   - Check user management features

3. **Test Credit Management**:
   - Go to admin ‚Üí users
   - Try editing a user's credits
   - Verify changes are saved

#### **3.2 Monitor Startup**
Watch for any startup issues after re-enabling features:

```bash
# Check production logs for errors
# Look for:
# - "self is not defined" errors
# - Missing environment variable errors
# - Database connection issues
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **If Site Won't Start After Re-enabling Features**

#### **Option 1: Gradual Re-enablement**
Re-enable features one at a time:

```env
# Start with just cloud services
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CLOUD_SERVICES=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CHARTS=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_IMAGE_PROCESSING=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANIMATIONS=false
```

#### **Option 2: Check for Build Errors**
If build fails, check for:
- Missing environment variables
- Import errors in chart components
- R2 configuration issues

### **If Credit Application Still Not Working**

#### **Check Production Database**
```bash
# Run database diagnostic
npx tsx scripts/diagnose-credit-application.ts
```

#### **Check User Roles**
```bash
# List all users and their roles
npx tsx scripts/list-all-users.ts
```

#### **Verify API Access**
```bash
# Test API endpoint directly
npx tsx scripts/test-credit-api.ts
```

### **If R2 Features Not Working**

#### **Check R2 Configuration**
```bash
# Test R2 connection
npx tsx scripts/test-r2-connection.ts
```

#### **Verify Environment Variables**
Ensure all R2 variables are set correctly in production.

## üìã **Deployment Checklist**

## üîÑ **Rollback Plan**

If re-enabling features causes issues:

### **Immediate Rollback**
```env
# Disable all features temporarily
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CLOUD_SERVICES=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CHARTS=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_IMAGE_PROCESSING=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANIMATIONS=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PERF_MONITORING=false
```
